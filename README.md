# BPMNgine
We use jBPM/JBoss BRMS as a coe part of our architecture at work.  I am not a massive fan of Java, so this is my attempt to 
create a useful process execution environment built in Node.js.  

This isn't intended to be used in any production environment and thus there is no warranty, applied to otherwise, for anyone 
who chooses to use this software in a production environment at their own risk.
